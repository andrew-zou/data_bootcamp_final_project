# data_bootcamp_final_project

**Final Project for Data Bootcamp** 

This project was completed by Andrew Zou in partial fulfilment of ECON-UB.0232, Data Bootcamp, Spring 2019. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project. In particular, I have:

Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own. The incorporation of the work of others-including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated wiht quotation marks), or paraphrasing thereof- has been fully aond appropriately referenced using notations both in the text and the bibliography.
And I understand that:

Submitting the same or substantialy similar work in ultiple courses, either in the same semester or in a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbidden. 

I ackonwledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for the project and course.
