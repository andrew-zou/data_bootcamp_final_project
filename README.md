# data_bootcamp_final_project

**Final Project for Data Bootcamp** 

This project was completed by Andrew Zou in partial fulfilment of ECON-UB.0232, Data Bootcamp, Spring 2019. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project. In particular, I have:

Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own. The incorporation of the work of others-including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), or paraphrasing thereof- has been fully aond appropriately referenced using notations both in the text and the bibliography.
And I understand that:

Submitting the same or substantialy similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester or in a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbidden. 

I acknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for the project and course. 


**Project Description:**
This project will explore global property price trends over the past decade, examining indexed, real data compiled by BIS. The first part of the project ranks the countries by largest percent change in the last five years and the last ten years. The second part of the project displays the data on three heat maps: one for the years 2008 to 2013, one for the years 2013 to 2018, and one for the years 2008 to 2018.
